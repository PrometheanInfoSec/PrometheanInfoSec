##Description
TALOS is an evolution in the democratization of Active Defense technologies
and methodologies. It is an Active Defense Framework; allowing for the quick
training and deployment of computer network defenders. Rather than having
to train for each tool individually, every tool in TALOS can be launched
through the same process. Modify the options, issue the run command.

TALOS is currently in limited alpha release. And will be recieving many
updates shortly. Please stay tuned, and don't be afraid to download the
latest release!
